Namaste Github Family!

🍕 LARANA Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project 📊

Excited to share my recent project where I worked with a comprehensive Pizza Sales Dataset to perform end-to-end data analysis using Excel and SQL!

🔗 Data Analysis Using SQL

⦁	select * from Pizza;
⦁	SELECT SUM(Total_Price) AS total_revenue FROM Pizza ;
⦁	SELECT Pizza_Type, COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM Pizza GROUP BY Pizza_Type ORDER BY order_count DESC;
⦁	SELECT Size, AVG(Price_Per_Item) FROM Pizza GROUP BY Size;
⦁	SELECT Date, SUM(Total_Price) AS daily_sales FROM Pizza GROUP BY Date ORDER BY Date;

✅ Explored key business insights such as: 

• Best-selling pizza types 
• Revenue trends by month 
• Sales performance by size & category 
• Customer buying behavior
